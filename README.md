# Map-Generator
A procedural generator of Tolkien-style maps. 

`map_gen` is the old, slow version and is no longer being developed. `map_gen_2` is the newer, faster version currently being developed. `map_gen_2` has two drawing tools, `MapCanvasBasic` and `MapCanvas`. `MapCanvasBasic` uses a simple Tkinter Canvas and PIL system. `MapCanvas` uses PIL and aggdraw for much improved quality.

Example map (`map_gen_2`):
